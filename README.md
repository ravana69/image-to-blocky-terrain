# Image to Blocky Terrain

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/dyoWaxe](https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/dyoWaxe).

Upload an image and see it turned into Minecraft-like terrain! You can also control the maximum height in blocks the terrain can reach.

Update 3/1/20: Used a linear gradient as the initial image to better explain the idea of the output.
